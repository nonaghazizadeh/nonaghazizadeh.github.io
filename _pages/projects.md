            <br>This project involves classifying documents and tokens, and recognizing named entities. Document classification uses Naive Bayes and Transformers. Token classification uses a text-question input to provide an answer, employing two approaches. Named Entity Recognition identifies and categorizes named entities in unstructured text.
