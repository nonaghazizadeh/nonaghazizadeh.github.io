## Volunteer Work

###  Recurrent Neural Networks and Contextual Embedding Lecture Note

Developed a comprehensive lecture note for a course in Natural Language Processing. This note encompasses advanced topics such as Recursive Neural Networks, which are a type of deep learning model designed to recognize patterns in sequential data and hierarchically structured data. Additionally, the note delves into the realm of Contextual Embedding, featuring models like TagLM, ELMo, and ULMFit. These models represent a significant leap in the field as they consider the context of words in a sentence, leading to a more nuanced understanding of language.
