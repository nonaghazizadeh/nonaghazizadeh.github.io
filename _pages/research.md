### Developing Automated Medical Report Generation for Fundus Fluorescein Angiography Images (A Novel Approach in Ophthalmology Research)
This paper introduces a model that utilizes FFA-IR datasets, which comprise Fundus Fluorescein Angiography Images and their corresponding reports. The model generates a report for each case based on patient's images by following the steps below:

- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) serves as the encoder, extracting features from the medical images.
- Cross-modal mapping aligns the visual and textual features of a medical image and its report. Shared memory records the mappings between visual and textual information.
- A reinforcement learning (RL) strategy over a cross-modal memory (CMM) is proposed to enhance the alignment of visual and textual features. The reinforcement algorithm learns the signal from the reports to guide the cross-modal alignment.
