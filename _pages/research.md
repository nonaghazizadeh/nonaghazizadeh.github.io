### Developing Automated Medical Report Generation for Fundus Fluorescein Angiography Images (A Novel Approach in Ophthalmology Research)
It introduces a model that utilizes FFA-IR datasets, which comprise Fundus Fluorescein Angiography Images and their corresponding reports. The model generates a report for each case based on patient's images by following the steps below:

- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) serves as the encoder, extracting features from the medical images.
- Cross-modal mapping aligns the visual and textual features of a medical image and its report. Shared memory records the mappings between visual and textual information.
- A reinforcement learning (RL) strategy over a cross-modal memory (CMM) is proposed to enhance the alignment of visual and textual features. The reinforcement algorithm learns the signal from the reports to guide the cross-modal alignment.

### Utilizing Large Language Models for Medical Question Answering in Persian and English
It introduces a model that utilizes PubMed QA and PubMed summarization datasets for answering questions and novel dataset including persian-english sentences with translated disease names. This model is equipped to respond to medical questions in both Persian and English by following these steps:
- A dataset is created using a Large Language Models (LLMs) to formulate sentences featuring disease names in both English and Persian.
- The small-100 translator model is fine-tuned with this dataset to accurately translate medical sentences from English to Persian and vice versa.
- The PubMed QA dataset is used to obtain embeddings via Bio-Bert.
- ElasticSearch is utilized for vector search, which produces a multitude of documents.
- Bio-Bert, T5, and Large Language Models (LLMs) are used to summarize the documents provided by ElasticSearch. The T5 and Bio-Bert models are fine-tuned using the PubMed summarization dataset.

### Utilizing Large Language Models for Multilingual News Question Answering
It introduces a model that utilizes news dataset, generated by other students, for answering questions. This model is equipped to respond to news questions in all languages by following these steps:
- The small-100 translator model is evaluated for its ability to accurately translate sentences in different languages.
- Use Bio-Bert in order to get embedding.
- ElasticSearch is utilized for vector search, which produces a multitude of news documents.
- T5 and Large Language Models (LLMs) are used to summarize the documents provided by ElasticSearch (The T5 model is fine-tuned).
