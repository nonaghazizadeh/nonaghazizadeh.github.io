My name is Nona Ghazizadeh. I am a first year Ph.D. Student in the Brain and Cognitive Science at the University of Southern California. I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology. My fields of interest are Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Brain & Computational Cognitive Science. I am especially interested in investigating the neural correlates of moral language in prosocial behavior using NLP.
